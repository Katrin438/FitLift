##Concept:
â€œOur concept revolves around solving the multiple issues that could arise after someone decides they would like to go to the gym consistently. Boredom, annoyance, lack of feedback, overthinking, lack of social connection are the ones we decided to tackle.
By using FitLift the user can get real time feedback while performing an exercise without being interrupted. They can also play a game similar to popular Super Mario or Flappy Bird games in which you avoid obstacles in the environment. You can also meet your potential gym buddy if you happen to go to a gym where somebody also uses FitLift and you can challenge them to a game and play together."


How does the app work:
The app uses the sensors in the device such as the gyroscope and accelorometer to track movement and register a completed repetition. IN the example of the push up the app uses the proximity sensor to detect if something is close to the device and registers a push up like that. 
In this case the phone is on the ground and the user does push ups over it. If the user would like to do squats for example the ap uses the gyroscope to detect if the phone is "upright" (when placed in the pocket) and if it is "laying down" (when the user's leg go below parallel to the groud when performing a squat) and registers a repetition.

Beforehand the user sets their desired sets and repetitions per set and can start the workout when they want. The app will provide feedback in real time and at the end will give the user an accuracy score as well as some information about the calories they burned and the total duration.
